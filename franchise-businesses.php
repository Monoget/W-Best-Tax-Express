                                    Running a franchise business can be a very attractive option for many entrepreneurs. You don’t have nearly as much risk as starting a new business, you have a done-for-you set of business practices and procedures, and a lot of the “mistake making” has already been done.

                                    There are a few cons though. For example, there’s typically a costly initial franchise fee that you must pay the franchisor, performance obligations, and employee overhead.

                                    You are also still responsible for the day-to-day operations of the business, such as managing employees, handling inventory, sales, and accounting. As your business grows, it’s typically a good idea to begin to outsource tasks like accounting and bookkeeping to a professional.

                                    As a franchise owner, it’s important that the accountant you work with has experience in franchise accounting as it is a bit different than accounting for a typical small business. Franchise accountants know the ins and outs of how a franchise works and the intricacies involved in financial reporting.

                                    There are three critical factors in Franchise Reporting
