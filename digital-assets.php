                                <p class="mb-20">
                                    The rise of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Dogecoin presents many challenges for businesses. Among them are finding a CPA or tax preparation and accounting firm that is knowledgeable - and experienced - in taxation issues, as well as navigating laws and regulations that are constantly evolving.
                                </p>

                                <h3 class="mb-3">Taxation of Digital and Virtual Currency</h3>
                                <p class="mb-20">
                                    Cryptocurrency is a form of digital or virtual payment or currency that can be exchanged online for goods and services. These exchanges use a secure computer technology platform called blockchain to validate and record transactions digitally on a digital ledger.
                                </p>
                                <p class="mb-20">
                                    Because the IRS defines virtual currency as a digital representation of value, it is treated as property for tax purposes. Therefore, whether you experience a gain or loss, it must be reported on Schedule D of IRS Form 1040. Long-term gains (assets held more than 12 months) are subject to capital gains tax rates, whereas short-term gains of less than 12 months are taxed as ordinary income.
                                </p>
