                                <p class="mb-20">
                                    Cash flow refers to the movement of money flowing into and out of a business. Positive cash flow is when a business owner brings in more money than spent. It is what every business owner strives for because it enables him/her to pay off liabilities and invest in the business.

                                    Conversely, if the business owner is spending more money than he/she is bringing in, it is called negative cash flow. While there will be times when every business experiences temporary periods of negative cash flow, too many months of negative cash flow can - and will - cause a business to fail.
